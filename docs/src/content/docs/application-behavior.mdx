title: Application Behavior
---

Legato offers several options to customize how the application behaves on your system, making it fit seamlessly into your workflow.

## System Tray Integration

### Minimize to Tray

When enabled, closing the main window will minimize Legato to the system tray instead of quitting the application. This keeps Legato running in the background, ready for quick access when needed.

To access Legato from the system tray, simply click on the Legato icon in your system tray.

This feature is particularly useful when combined with [background scanning](/legato/scanning-projects#automatic-background-scanning), as Legato can continue to scan for new projects in the background even when the main window is closed. This ensures your project library stays up-to-date without requiring the application to be visibly open.

### Start Minimized

When enabled, Legato will start minimized to the system tray instead of opening the main window. This is useful if you want Legato to run in the background without interrupting your workflow.

This option works well in combination with the [Auto Start](#auto-start) feature, allowing Legato to start automatically with your system but remain unobtrusive.

## Startup Options

### Auto Start

Configure Legato to automatically start when your computer boots up, ensuring your project manager is always available.

When enabled, Legato will be added to your system's startup applications list.
